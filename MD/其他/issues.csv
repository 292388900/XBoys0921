I tried my first export in about 6 months. It was the first time since different currencies exported to different files (in case this is related). I was trying to export to Google Drive (using ""Share..."" and selecting Google Drive). Oddly, it isn't GnuCash crashing, it is the Google Drive app crashing. But it crashes immediately after I select a folder, and the files are not uploaded. I have never seen Google Drive crash under any other circumstances.\r\nI tried about 5 times, and it failed consistently each time. I tried the same thing on my wife's phone and got the exact same crashing results. (Her phone is a more standard Android setup than mine.) But exporting to SD card and then doing a Google Drive upload from the file manager worked without issue.\r\nSo there is an easy enough workaround for now.﻿\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nExporting multi-currency transactions to Google Drive should not cause app crash\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nApp crashes when multi-currency transactions are exported to Google Drive\r\n\r\n#### Software specifications\r\n* GnuCash Android version:\r\n* System Android version:\r\n* Device type:\r\n","2017-04-16T17:10:08Z","9","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/672/comments","2017-04-15T16:43:32Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/672/events","https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/672","221958867","[{""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/labels/bug"",""color"":""b60205"",""default"":true,""id"":""5373900"",""name"":""bug""}]","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/672/labels{/name}",false,"{""description"":""Feature Focus: Backup & Sync\r\n\r\n- Select backup folder which uses SAF\r\n- Use FileProvider when exporting (remove need for SD_CARD permission on startup)\r\n- Sync files which are opened with SAF - keep the rest of the file which is not parseable."",""title"":""v2.2.0"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestones/2"",""labels_url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestones/2/labels"",""created_at"":""2016-08-05T23:08:27Z"",""creator"":{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/276699?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""codinguser"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""276699"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/followers""},""number"":""2"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestone/2"",""updated_at"":""2017-04-17T20:20:33Z"",""due_on"":""2017-04-30T07:00:00Z"",""state"":""open"",""closed_issues"":""10"",""open_issues"":""4"",""closed_at"":null,""id"":""1926411""}","672",,"https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android","closed","Crash when exporting directly to Google Drive with multi-currency","2017-04-17T12:44:24Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/672","{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/276699?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""codinguser"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""276699"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/followers""}"

Create two books.\n2. With `Book 1` active, create a widget looking at any account in `Book 1`\n3. Open `Book 2` (making it active), then restart your device\n4. Observe that the widget created in step 2 no longer displays the selected account\n#### Expected behaviour\n\nThe widget continues to display the account it was created with.\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nThe widget displays ""Account name"" and one button which does nothing (there are two buttons if this is done on the `develop` branch). Clicking on the widget also does nothing.\n\nIf you re-open `Book 1` and restart your device the widget will return to displaying the correct account.\n#### My Thoughts\n\nI've taken a look at the code, and the configuration saving/restoring needs to be rewritten. It's currently stored in the `SharedPreferences` for the account's book, but then if/when the widget is updated it tries to read the active book's `SharedPreferences`. We can solve this by either\n1. having one big ""widget"" `SharedPreferences` object, and storing the book as another option for each widget, or\n2. we can have a separate `SharedPreferences` object for each widget\n\nI have a slight preference for the second option, but the first is more similar to the current implementation.\n","2016-10-31T18:04:29Z","4","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/607/comments","2016-10-27T10:25:45Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/607/events","https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/607","185629912","[{""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/labels/bug"",""color"":""b60205"",""default"":true,""id"":""5373900"",""name"":""bug""}]","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/607/labels{/name}",false,"{""description"":""Feature Focus: Backup & Sync\r\n\r\n- Select backup folder which uses SAF\r\n- Use FileProvider when exporting (remove need for SD_CARD permission on startup)\r\n- Sync files which are opened with SAF - keep the rest of the file which is not parseable."",""title"":""v2.2.0"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestones/2"",""labels_url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestones/2/labels"",""created_at"":""2016-08-05T23:08:27Z"",""creator"":{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/276699?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""codinguser"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""276699"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/followers""},""number"":""2"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestone/2"",""updated_at"":""2017-04-17T20:20:33Z"",""due_on"":""2017-04-30T07:00:00Z"",""state"":""open"",""closed_issues"":""10"",""open_issues"":""4"",""closed_at"":null,""id"":""1926411""}","607",,"https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android","closed","Widgets stop functioning after changing book","2016-10-31T18:04:29Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/607","{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/czan/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/czan/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/czan/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/czan"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/czan/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/czan"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/czan/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1835975?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/czan/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/czan/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/czan/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""czan"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""1835975"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/czan/followers""}"

"ObjectId(""58f573cdce6ce53320ad3172"")","null","[]","Business Case:\nWe use gnucash-android to view balances while on the go using xml data imported from gnucash desktop. We don't necessarily export to gnucash desktop at this time. As transactions are added to gnucash desktop, the xml file is saved to dropbox. We then manually import into gnucash-android. On initial set up we identify and typically mark five Favorites for easy access. On the next import the Favorites are blank (erased). A selectable option to 'Keep Favorites in Between Imports' would provide an adequate working feature.\n\nCurrent Functionality:\nFavorites are erased if a new import with the same accounts/etc is performed.\n\nExpected Functionality:\nA selectable option, that when checked saves the Favorites for redisplay when the new import with the same accounts/ets is performed.\n\nImpact:\nWould reduce the need to mark Favorites on each import. In our case this could mean a reduction in the number of clicks from 25 to 0. Ultimately, it would provide a more user friendly experience.\n\nPriority:\nLow/Nice to have. However, we suspect if others are doing the same they too may have run in to this situation and would also appreciate a reduction in the number of clicks.\n","null",0,"https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/558/comments","2016-08-24T20:06:49Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/558/events","https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/558","173045493","[{""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/labels/enhancement"",""color"":""84b6eb"",""default"":true,""id"":""5373902"",""name"":""enhancement""}]","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/558/labels{/name}",false,"{""description"":""Try to sync DBs between Android and desktop.\r\nThis will require a lot of rewrites of many parts of the application"",""title"":""v3.0.0"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestones/10"",""labels_url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestones/10/labels"",""created_at"":""2017-01-23T08:41:47Z"",""creator"":{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/276699?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""codinguser"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""276699"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/followers""},""number"":""10"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestone/10"",""updated_at"":""2017-04-12T15:26:15Z"",""due_on"":""2018-01-30T08:00:00Z"",""state"":""open"",""closed_issues"":0,""open_issues"":""2"",""closed_at"":null,""id"":""2270629""}","558",,"https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android","open","Enhancement Request: Option to keep Favorites in Place Between Imports","2017-04-12T15:26:00Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/558","{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/mpadilla2/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/mpadilla2/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/mpadilla2/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/mpadilla2"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/mpadilla2/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/mpadilla2"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/mpadilla2/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6785708?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/mpadilla2/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/mpadilla2/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/mpadilla2/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""mpadilla2"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""6785708"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/mpadilla2/followers""}"

In fact it took me a while to realize what was going on. When doing a post with split currencies, the work flow does something unnatural. I'll try to explain:\n- post a transaction that splits currencies (such as a 300 THB expense paid for with a USD credit card)\n- once everything is setup in the transaction window, click save\n- the currency exchange window pops up. (This is expected.)\n- once you complete filling in the currency exchange window and close it, it returns back to the transaction window. (This is the unexpected part.)\n- you then have to click save in the transaction window a second time in order to complete the transaction.\n\nSince for single currency transactions, clicking save closes the transaction window and completes the transaction, is there a reason that you have to click save twice to close the split currency transaction? Isn't the expected behavior that after completing the exchange rate step, the transaction is already completed and saved (since you've already clicked the save button) and the transaction window closed?\n﻿\n","null",0,"https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/556/comments","2016-08-23T05:49:29Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/556/events","https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/556","172617494","[{""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/labels/enhancement"",""color"":""84b6eb"",""default"":true,""id"":""5373902"",""name"":""enhancement""}]","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/556/labels{/name}",false,"{""description"":""Feature Focus: Budgeting - create / import / export / report\r\nImprove: Transactions handling  - bulk delete (in accounts), sorting, searching, segmented views\r\nAdd support for reconciliation of transactions\r\n\r\n"",""title"":""v2.3.0"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestones/1"",""labels_url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestones/1/labels"",""created_at"":""2016-08-05T23:07:49Z"",""creator"":{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/276699?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""codinguser"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""276699"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/followers""},""number"":""1"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestone/1"",""updated_at"":""2017-01-23T09:02:46Z"",""due_on"":""2017-05-31T07:00:00Z"",""state"":""open"",""closed_issues"":0,""open_issues"":""9"",""closed_at"":null,""id"":""1926410""}","556",,"https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android","open","After TransferFund dialog closes, immediately save the transaction","2016-08-23T05:49:29Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/556","{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/276699?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""codinguser"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""276699"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/followers""}"

This causes a template transaction to be created with an imbalance split (in [`GncXmlHandler.endElement`](https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/org/gnucash/android/importer/GncXmlHandler.java#L691)) and with a currency code as account UID.\n\nThe currency code as account UID in the split should be fixed when we finish parsing in [`GncXmlHandler.endDocument`](https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/org/gnucash/android/importer/GncXmlHandler.java#L901), however, the scheduled actions are parsed first, and here's the problem. When a scheduled action has been parsed, [`GncXmlHandler.generateMissedScheduledTransactions`](https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/org/gnucash/android/importer/GncXmlHandler.java#L795) is called. This method clones the template transaction, but the split with the currency code as account UID isn't added to `mAutoBalanceSplits` so as to be fixed at the end.\n\nReceived through User Voice (110).\n","2016-08-10T13:23:44Z","2","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/534/comments","2016-08-08T08:17:31Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/534/events","https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/534","169867011","[{""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/labels/bug"",""color"":""b60205"",""default"":true,""id"":""5373900"",""name"":""bug""}]","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/534/labels{/name}",false,"{""description"":""Release focus on multiple books within the application and scheduled transaction optimizations"",""title"":""v2.1.0"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestones/3"",""labels_url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestones/3/labels"",""created_at"":""2016-08-08T09:02:20Z"",""creator"":{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/276699?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""codinguser"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""276699"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/codinguser/followers""},""number"":""3"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/milestone/3"",""updated_at"":""2016-08-31T08:42:59Z"",""due_on"":""2016-09-30T07:00:00Z"",""state"":""closed"",""closed_issues"":""19"",""open_issues"":0,""closed_at"":""2016-08-31T08:42:59Z"",""id"":""1928732""}","534",,"https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android","closed","787 foreign key constraint error caused by unfixed balance split","2016-08-10T13:23:44Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/534","{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/rivaldi8"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1187977?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""rivaldi8"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""1187977"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/followers""}"

I receive a letter from the bank saying that from a date two months away, my monthly repayment will change. So what I want to do is change the existing scheduled transaction so that it stops when appropriate and create a new one that starts the month later.\n\nSo, I place the cursor on one of the past transactions and click on the button,""create a scheduled transaction ... "". But, instead of creating a new one, it wants to edit the old one.\n\nNow, of course I don't want to create a new transaction from scratch. The ""create"" button is just too easy. The only work around I have found is to go to a similar transaction several years ago, one, I suppose, not created by the existing scheduled transaction. Then the system does create a new scheduled transaction.\n\nThis isn't a big deal. It just doesn't work the way I expected it to.\n\nCheers\n\nPeter\n","2016-02-02T08:41:59Z","1","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/455/comments","2015-12-23T04:39:34Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/455/events","https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/455","123601133","[]","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/455/labels{/name}",false,"null","455",,"https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android","closed","New scheduled transaction like an existing one","2016-02-02T08:41:59Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/455","{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/pjridge/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/pjridge/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/pjridge/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/pjridge"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/pjridge/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/pjridge"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/pjridge/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13363499?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/pjridge/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/pjridge/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/pjridge/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""pjridge"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""13363499"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/pjridge/followers""}"

My current book is stored in XML. I copied my gnucash data to a folder on Google Drive, and I've verified that it is syncing between devices. I can open it on the Android app just fine, and add additional transactions, but those transactions aren't reflected when I open it on the Desktop version. I have enabled Google Drive Sync in the Backup Preferences menu, and allowed it to run on my Google account. I have set the Default Export Format to XML, and have enabled `Export all transactions`. \n\nWhen I make a change or add a transaction, I see it reflected in the application. It does not seem to automatically sync. If I select the `Export` option in the `Transactions` section of the menu and select `Google Drive` as the Export Destination, I see that it has connected to Google, and it says `Exported to: Google Drive -> GnuCash`.

I also made widget vertical size resize-able, so anyone can return to 2-row widget if he got used to it :)\n\nResult:\n\n![3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7319485/10416808/61dddae2-702e-11e5-8591-e8be038d4b45.png)\n\nPS: Why button is not square ? Android has no easy way to ""centerInside"" backgroung of buttons, so it is not trivial to make it square. And squeezed button looks pretty good too.\n\nPS2: This patch does not change widget view on standard screens, widget button is as square as before on standard screens.\n","2017-01-11T09:20:12Z","4","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/404/comments","2015-10-11T13:18:08Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/404/events","https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/pull/404","110855389","[]","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/404/labels{/name}",false,"null","404","{""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/pulls/404"",""diff_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/pull/404.diff"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/pull/404"",""patch_url"":""https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/pull/404.patch""}","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android","closed","Fixes widget view on Lollipop 5.1.1 with dense sceen grid","2017-01-11T09:20:12Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/404","{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/alpha-and-omega/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/alpha-and-omega/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/alpha-and-omega/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/alpha-and-omega"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/alpha-and-omega/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/alpha-and-omega"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/alpha-and-omega/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7319485?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/alpha-and-omega/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/alpha-and-omega/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/alpha-and-omega/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""alpha-and-omega"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""7319485"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/alpha-and-omega/followers""}"

I guess, because it's an attribute only supported since API level 11, while GnuCash defines `minSdkVersion 10`.\n\nIn [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17914017/android-4-3-menu-item-showasaction-always-ignored) they suggest to change the attribute's namespace, but then it doesn't compile. I guess it only works with `ActionBarCompat`.\n\nIf there's no reason behind the build tools version change other than using the latest, it could be reverted to the previously working one.\n\nAnother possibility would be to migrate to `ActionBarCompat`. Not sure how hard it would be or if it would even solve the problem. By the way, is this change in planned? I could do it if needed.\n\nThis happens with version 1.6.0 of GnuCash from a Huawei Ascend G300 (Android 2.3.6, API 10).\n","2015-06-21T17:12:18Z","2","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/344/comments","2015-06-21T11:01:32Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/344/events","https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/344","89896909","[]","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/344/labels{/name}",false,"null","344",,"https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android","closed","Buttons are no longer shown in action bars","2015-06-21T17:12:18Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/344","{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/rivaldi8"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1187977?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""rivaldi8"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""1187977"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/followers""}"

"ObjectId(""58f573d9ce6ce53320ad326b"")","null","[]","I've had some confusion with the new transaction autocomplete function based on templates and I think it make bring some usability problems.\n\nI've been looking for advantages of the new system, but the only I can think of is that now the user can select which transactions will appear in the autocomplete llist. This makes the list smaller and saves typing.\n\nHowever, I see some disadvantages:\n- When the user upgrades she'll have to either edit each transaction and check the option for it to appear in the dropdown or she'll have to type again these transactions.\n- Requires more interaction from the user. In addition, she now has to scroll to the end of the form and check the option.\n- The user must know the option exists. Taking into account that it's at the end of the form and, provably below the fold, makes it more difficult for the user to discover it.\n- The user may not relate the ""Save as template"" with the autocompletion. In my case I didn't relate it until I looked at the code.\n- The user may forget to check the ""Save as template"" option. He'd have to edit the transaction again to check the option or remember to check it when he enters the transaction again the next time.\n- The behaviour is different from that of other applications and from previous versions of GnuCash. This can confuse users that expect the previous behaviour [[1]](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-top-ten-web-design-mistakes-of-1999/)(point 3) and think (like me) that it's a bug. I can't think of any application where the autocomplete entries of a form are explicitly selected by the user.\n- The option adds more clutter to the interface. In my opinion, GnuCash should strive to have simpler screens instead of adding more options.\n- If the user decides he no longer wants the transaction to appear in the dropdown, it may be difficult for him to find the one he marked as template.\n\nIs there any other problem that the new behaviour solves apart from the number of transactions in the autocomplete dropdown? I there isn't, I'd rather go for improving the quality of the entries. For example, listing at the top the ones matching from the same account, the more recent, avoiding duplicates, etc.\n\nRight now, in the worst case, the user just has to continue typing some more to filter out the unwanted entries.\n","2015-06-19T10:02:48Z","5","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/309/comments","2015-04-09T18:33:27Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/309/events","https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/309","67424045","[]","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/309/labels{/name}",false,"null","309",,"https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android","closed","The new transaction autocomplete behaviour in develop may have usability problems","2015-06-19T10:02:48Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/309","{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/rivaldi8"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1187977?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""rivaldi8"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""1187977"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/rivaldi8/followers""}"

Even if I change the value before saving the entry, the old value is retained.  Editing the entry later has the same result, the old transaction amount sticks.  Luckly I caught this before too many entries were affected.\n\nI would like to be able to completely disable the autocomplete feature, or at least disable the automatic population of the transaction amount.

"ObjectId(""58f573dbce6ce53320ad32a1"")","null","[]","OFX and GIF both have their limitation, GncXML cannot be used for transfer transactions (it cannot be imported). Looking at the GnuCash import menu, it seem that only replay GnuCash Log can report everything GnuCash needs: multi-currency, double entry, description, notes, memo, etc. So I created this exporter for generating (fake) gnucash logs.\n\nHowever it also has its limitations, making it not a good way for normal user to use.\n1. The replay log function in GnuCash is not intended for export/impot, it will assume that the log is generated by GnuCash, so only limited error check is applied. This may easily cause the GnuCash book result in error state.\n2. Accounts are identified by GUID in the log, so only accounts already exist in GnuCash book can be corretly used.\n3. The log is basicly recorded in a split by split style, with two possibkle edit action: Edit(insert) and delete. With the current GnuCash Android internal DB, deletion of split cannot be recorded. So if a transaction is edited in GCA, with one split deleted, others modified, the deletion cannot be replayed in GnuCash.

Transactions involving multiple currencies cannot be edited or created (as they cannot be transferred to GnuCash Android). However, they can be deleted.\n\niii. Transactions involving multiple currencies cannot be exported to QIF. QIF does not support these transactions so the result would be in error. They can be filtered out when exporting.\n\niv.

When you import a QIF into GnuCash Desktop you may select one (and only one) currency per import, and that is applied to all transactions in that import.\n\nTherefore, GnuCash Android needs to be able to export multiple QIF files. If a user of GnuCash is using two different currencies then he/she should be able to (with one click) export two QIF files (one for currency A, and one for currency B). The user will then do two imports into GnuCash Desktop, and select the correct currency for each QIF file imported.\n","2014-10-16T09:50:36Z","11","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/218/comments","2014-09-17T07:58:30Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/218/events","https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/218","42975985","[]","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/218/labels{/name}",false,"null","218",,"https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android","closed","Multiple Currencies, Export Multiple QIF files","2014-10-16T09:50:36Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/218","{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/webmanoffesto/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/webmanoffesto/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/webmanoffesto/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/webmanoffesto"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/webmanoffesto/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/webmanoffesto"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/webmanoffesto/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8778254?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/webmanoffesto/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/webmanoffesto/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/webmanoffesto/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""webmanoffesto"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""8778254"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/webmanoffesto/followers""}"

Tested with my multi-currency book and the balance shown is the same as the original approach. Didn't test when recurrence transactions are involved.\n\nCreated a new entry function taking GUID as parameter instead of rowIdx.\n\nNow the balance is calculated in this way:\n1. get the all related accounts, i.e. all descendent account of the current account whose currency is the same the parent account. \n2. Use SQL query to get the balance. The SQL statement is something like :\n  `SELECT TOTAL ( CASE WHEN splits.type = 'DEBIT' THEN splits.amount ELSE - splits.amount END ) FROM splits, transactions WHERE splits.account_uid in ( accounts_list ) AND splits.transaction_uid = transactions.uid AND transaction.recurrence_period = 0`\n3. adjust he returned value with the parent account's type. \n\nPossible draw backs may be that floating point calculation and floating point number are used in step 2, which is always bad when money is involved. However, double precision should be precise enough for this task with proper rounding, when no number more than 10e12 is involved. Don't know if any currency would need that large number.

(The original import mode is also left there. The two import mode can be switched easily on code level.)\n\nMain modifications on bulk mode:\n1. Account, Transaction, Split are not inserted into the db when they are encountered. The information are gather and saved, and they are all inserted into the db at the end of the parsing the XML file.\n2. `beginTransation()`, `setsetTransactionSuccessful()`, `endTransaction()` methods are used to control db transactions, thus _all or none_ of the accounts (or transaction, splits) would be inserted/updated into the db.\n3. `SQLiteStatement` is used instead `insert` or `update` call. (Several articles [like this](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/turbocharge-your-sqlite-inserts-on-android/) claims this should much faster)\n4. `REPLACE INTO` SQL statement is used instead of the original _'query and insert/update'_ approach.\n5. Transaction's exported state will not be modified when inserting Splits.\n6. Full name of Account is not generated after the insertion. They must be generated before the insertion.\n\nThese modifications used a faster db insertion approach, and eliminated a lot of db access.\n\nImport time comparison after applying 498bf48 (times are in seconds):\n\n| Test file | before | after | db access time |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| File1 | 689.828 | 43.084 | 9.103 |\n| File2 | 16.119 | 1.767 | 0.509 |\n\nFile 1 contains 257 accounts, 8448 transactions and 17333 splits.\nFile 2 contains 39 accounts, 205 transactions and 412 splits\nThe 'db access time' is the time used by bulk insertion after the commit. It is hard to calculate the db access time before the commit as they are scattered everywhere during import process.\n\nNote in debug mode (when you hit 'debug' in the IDE instead of 'run'), the App can be much slower, and will take 30min to import File1 before the commit and 8min after.\n\nPossible defects:\n1. Exceptions during db insertion are caught, so the main import procedure will not know about them and report success. May consider re-throwing.\n2. Insertion of Accounts, Transaction and Splits are independent. So there is a possibility that all accounts are imported, but no transactions or splits, or all transactions are imported but no splits. I think the former may be tolerable, but the latter may cause problems.\n\nMore commits may follow up to deal with the defects.\n\nMore commits may also follow up in the performance improvements in other parts of the App ( Such as balance calculation, exporting, etc).

For example I spent some money in the shop and I want to make a transaction that I bought some food in my mobile gnucash. \n\nHere I will talk about how this can be released in ui. \n\nBelow the double-entry book-keeping is discussed.\nTo do the transaction I need two things: Select two Accounts(from & to) and type a sum. In our case this will be cashes ""Wallet"" and ""Spendings/food"". \nSo what I offer: I press the ""new fast transaction"" button(blue or red circle) and black buttons to left of the accounts appear. I press two, in order - from/to. Then the screen to type the sum and the comment appears. That's it.\n![2014-01-05_21 13 41](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3256572/1847075/ebb05332-7632-11e3-9930-72cf3c28685d.png)\n\nThis is not the only solution.

The posting should also show up as positive on the asset account if debit, and as negative if credit.\n\nCurrently, when I add a transaction on an asset account 'A', enter value 50 and chose debit (a red ""DEBIT"" with a green bar below is displayed), then the amount is displayed as negative and A's balance will be decreased. Or is it that if 'DEBIT' is displayed, it means, 'If you press this button, the transaction will be a debit?' That would be quite confusing.\n\nCheers,\nMartin\n","2013-12-09T13:54:04Z","1","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/78/comments","2013-05-29T17:51:48Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/78/events","https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/78","14903126","[{""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/labels/enhancement"",""color"":""84b6eb"",""default"":true,""id"":""5373902"",""name"":""enhancement""}]","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/78/labels{/name}",false,"null","78",,"https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android","closed","Debit/credit mixed up?","2013-12-09T13:54:04Z","https://api.github.com/repos/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues/78","{""following_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/NimoTh/following{/other_user}"",""events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/NimoTh/events{/privacy}"",""organizations_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/NimoTh/orgs"",""url"":""https://api.github.com/users/NimoTh"",""gists_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/NimoTh/gists{/gist_id}"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/NimoTh"",""subscriptions_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/NimoTh/subscriptions"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2595836?v=3"",""repos_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/NimoTh/repos"",""received_events_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/NimoTh/received_events"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""starred_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/NimoTh/starred{/owner}{/repo}"",""site_admin"":false,""login"":""NimoTh"",""type"":""User"",""id"":""2595836"",""followers_url"":""https://api.github.com/users/NimoTh/followers""}"
